## General Information
As a coding boot camp student, it is important to practice the skills that I am learning. This Java Script quiz is a great way to do just that. I developed this app to learn how to manipulate DOM elements and as an introduction to the use of the browser's local storage. Once you click on the start button, you are presented with some guidelines for the quiz and given the option to exit or the continue. If you continue, you are presente with a question and the the quiz timer countdown begins. Once you select an answer, you are then provided with a next button that enables you to move throught the questions. If the timer gets to zero or you go through all the questions, the game ends. You are the provided a score that you are able to save and later view.
